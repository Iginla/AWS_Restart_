# :globe_with_meridians: Database operations project :globe_with_meridians: 

Today, we gained experience in a database operations project focusing on several key aspects:

## Selecting Data from a Database:
 I honed skills in using the SELECT statement to query databases, employing the COUNT() function and various operators like ```<, >, =, WHERE, ORDER BY, and AND``` for precise data retrieval.

## Performing a Conditional Search:
I mastered crafting search conditions with the WHERE clause, utilizing the BETWEEN operator, harnessing the LIKE operator with wildcard characters, creating column aliases using the AS operator, and incorporating functions in both SELECT statements and WHERE clauses.

## Working with Functions:
I gained proficiency in employing aggregate functions such as ```SUM(), MIN(), MAX(), and AVG()``` for data summarization, using functions like ```SUBSTRING_INDEX()``` for string manipulation, ```LENGTH() and TRIM()``` for string analysis, and ```DISTINCT()``` for record filtering to efficiently extract, process, and analyse data.

Finaly, practical projects using AWS EC2 compute service for MariaDB and documentation was equally done using Markdown and later pushed on github for version controlling and publication.

This experience has significantly enhanced my database operations expertise.
