Today, I gained experience in analyzing potential database errors such as data entry mistakes, 
incorrect data types, faulty codes, illogical entries, missing and duplicate data. I also honed 
skills in importing and exporting data (.csv files) using the LOAD DATA statement.

Additionally, I focused on data cleaning, a critical step in ensuring productivity and data accuracy.
I utilized SQL string functions like LEFT, RIGHT, and TRIM to enhance data quality and minimize errors.

In a hands-on lab project, I leveraged the EC2 Compute service through the AWS Management Console. 
This allowed me to perform various database operations including database and table creation/dropping,
altering table structures with ALTER, and executing SQL commands for data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). 
This practical experience fortified my proficiency in database management.
