## Lab 11 to 14:

## Lab 11: Working with the String Sequence and Numeric Weight of Insulin in Python
In the Python Basics module, you learned about variables, comments, math, concatenations, and exceptions.

Steps:
- We assign variables to the sequence of Human Sequence Insulin data. 
- A variable is assign to a string values.
- Each variable is assigned to a group of letters.
- Each letter is assigned a float value.

Challenges:

- Syntax Errors: Identation.

# lab 12: Calculating the Net Charge of Insulin by Using Python Lists and Loops

## Steps:

- We created a dictioonary lists, that contains key values pairs(KVP))
- The KVP in the strings were assigned to the 
- Did practical applications of data analytics in Python. From manipulating insulin's string sequence and numeric weight to calculating its net charge using lists, loops, and pKa values, the possibilities are vast. 
- Additionally, I explored encryption with a Caesar cipher, understanding its implementation and decryption. 


# Lab13:Using Functions to Implement a Caesar Cipher
## Steps:

- We delved into creating file handlers and modules for retrieving insulin data, using JSON files to calculate its molecular weight. 
- We worked on solidifying hands-on on Python's capabilities for data manipulation and encryption, paving the way for diverse applications in programming. 
- Involving the : 
implementing a Caesar cipher, a straightforward encryption technique that shifts each letter in a message by a set number of positions in the alphabet.

interaction with the user occurs via the input() function to obtain messages and cipher keys, with subsequent output of the encrypted and decrypted messages.

# Lab 14: Creating File Handlers and Modules for Retrieving Information about Insulin

## Steps:

- The JSON module in Python facilitates the handling of JSON data, which is commonly used for storing and exchanging structured data.

- Reading and parsing JSON data involves using the json.load() method, which converts JSON data into a Python dictionary.

- Effective error handling, such as using try-except blocks, can prevent program crashes when dealing with file operations.

Lastly, we pushed our codes into Github from AWS console and the Standalone environment.
