# AWS Certification Journey: SysOps and Systems Manager Labs üöÄ

Today, I advanced on the path to AWS Certification, conquering two Labs sessions! üõ†Ô∏è

## SysOps Lab Project
I dived into Systems Operations (SysOps), overseeing infrastructure administration, deployment, and monitoring. From managing permissions and policies in AWS IAM to root cause analysis and resolution procedures, it was a comprehensive experience.

**Objectives:**
- Install and Configure the AWS CLI.
- Establish a Secure Shell (SSH) connection to the instance.
- Configure the installation with an access key.
- Practice using AWS CLI to interact with AWS IAM.

**Tasks:**
- Connect to the Red Hat EC2 instance via SSH.
- Install AWS CLI on a Red Hat Linux instance.
- Observe IAM configuration details in the AWS Management Console.
- Configure AWS CLI to connect to your AWS Account.
- Explore IAM configuration using AWS CLI and reference documentation.

## AWS Systems Manager Capabilities Lab
Next, I delved into AWS Systems Manager, a powerful suite for centralized operational data and automation across AWS resources. From configuration verification to running tasks on multiple servers, it's a game-changer.

**Objectives:**
- Verify configurations and permissions.
- Run tasks on multiple servers.
- Update application settings or configurations.
- Access the command line on an instance.

**Tasks:**
- Generate inventory lists for managed instances via AWS Management Console.
- Install a custom web application (Widget Manufacturing Dashboard) using Run Command.
- Utilize Parameter Store for efficient application settings management.
- Leverage Session Manager for secure instance access, reinforced with IAM policies and AWS CloudTrail logs.
