## Lab 11 to 14:

## Lab 11: Working with the String Sequence and Numeric Weight of Insulin in Python
In the Python Basics module, you learned about variables, comments, math, concatenations, and exceptions.

Steps:
- We assign variables to the sequence of Human Insulin data.
- A variable is assigned a string value.
- lEach variable is assigned to a group of letters.
- Each letter is assigned a float value.
  
Challenges:
- Syntax Errors: Indentation.

# Lab 12: Calculating the Net Charge of Insulin by Using Python Lists and Loops

## Steps:
- We created a dictionary list that contains key-value pairs (KVP).
- The key-value pairs in the strings were assigned.
- I did practical applications of data analytics in Python. This ranged from manipulating the insulin string sequence and 
  numeric weight to calculating its net charge using lists, loops, and pKa values, showcasing vast possibilities.
- Additionally, I explored encryption with a Caesar cipher, gaining an understanding of its implementation and decryption.


# Lab 13:Using Functions to Implement a Caesar Cipher
## Steps:

- We delved into creating file handlers and modules for retrieving insulin data, using JSON files to calculate its molecular 
  weight.
- We worked on solidifying hands-on experience with Python's capabilities for data manipulation and encryption, paving the 
  way for diverse applications in programming.
- This included implementing a Caesar cipher, a straightforward encryption technique that shifts each letter in a message by 
  a set number of positions in the alphabet. Interaction with the user occurs via the input() function to obtain messages and   cipher keys, with subsequent output of the encrypted and decrypted messages.

# Lab 14: Creating File Handlers and Modules for Retrieving Information about Insulin

## Steps:

- The JSON module in Python facilitates the handling of JSON data, which is commonly used for storing and exchanging 
  structured data.
- Reading and parsing JSON data involves using the json.load() method, which converts JSON data into a Python dictionary.
- Effective error handling, such as using try-except blocks, can prevent program crashes when dealing with file operations.
- Lastly, we pushed our code into Github from the AWS console and the Standalone environment.
